Add to `.env.local`:

```bash
# OpenAI API Key (get from https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your-openai-api-key-here
```

**Important:** You need a valid OpenAI API key with billing enabled.

### 3. Run Database Migration

1. Open Supabase Dashboard ‚Üí SQL Editor
2. Open `migrations/005_transcription_schema.sql`
3. Copy the entire file contents
4. Paste into SQL Editor
5. Click "Run" to execute

**What this creates:**
- Enhanced `transcripts` table with transcription fields
- New `transcription_jobs` table for background processing
- RLS policies for security
- Utility functions and triggers
- Performance indexes

### 4. Restart Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Test the System

Follow the verification checklist below.

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

### Step 1: Upload Test Audio (if not already done)

1. Navigate to `/upload`
2. Upload a CSV file with a "Call" column
3. Upload matching audio file (MP3, WAV, M4A, or AAC)
4. Wait for upload to complete
5. Navigate to `/library`

### Step 2: View Call Library

- [ ] Library page loads successfully
- [ ] Calls are displayed with status badges

- [ ] Search bar works
- [ ] Timestamps are clickable
- [ ] Clicking timestamp seeks audio to that point

### Step 7: Test Audio Synchronization

- [ ] Play audio
- [ ] Current transcript segment highlights as audio plays
- [ ] Highlighting follows audio playback
- [ ] Clicking timestamp in transcript seeks audio

### Step 8: Edit Transcript

- [ ] Click "Edit Mode" button
- [ ] Text area appears with transcript
- [ ] Make changes to text
- [ ] Wait 2 seconds for auto-save
- [ ] "Saved" indicator appears
- [ ] Switch back to "View Mode"
- [ ] Changes are preserved

### Step 9: Search Transcript

- [ ] Enter search term in search box
- [ ] Matching text is highlighted
- [ ] Result count is shown
- [ ] Search works in both view and edit modes

### Step 10: Library Integration

- [ ] Return to `/library`
- [ ] Call now shows "‚úì Transcribed" badge
- [ ] Transcript preview appears under call
- [ ] Filter by "Transcribed" status works
- [ ] Search finds calls by transcript content

### Step 11: Keyboard Shortcuts

With audio playing:
- [ ] Press `Space` - pauses/plays
- [ ] Press `‚Üê` - skips backward 5s
- [ ] Press `‚Üí` - skips forward 5s
- [ ] Press `M` - mutes/unmutes

## üß™ Test Scenarios

### Happy Path
1. Upload audio file
2. Start transcription
3. Wait for completion
4. View transcript
5. Edit transcript
6. Search transcript
7. Export or share (future feature)

### Error Handling
1. **Missing API Key** - Should show configuration error
2. **Invalid Audio File** - Should validate before transcription
3. **Network Error** - Should retry with exponential backoff
4. **OpenAI API Error** - Should display user-friendly error

### Edge Cases
1. **Very Short Audio** (<5 seconds) - Should transcribe
2. **Long Audio** (>10 minutes) - Background processing
3. **Poor Audio Quality** - Lower confidence score
4. **Empty Transcript** - Should handle gracefully
5. **Multiple Simultaneous Transcriptions** - Should queue properly

## üîí Security Verification

### API Key Protection
- [ ] OpenAI API key is in `.env.local` (not committed)
- [ ] API key is NOT visible in browser DevTools
- [ ] API key is NOT in client-side bundles
- [ ] API routes use server-side only

### Row Level Security
- [ ] Users can only see their own calls
- [ ] Users can only see their own transcripts
- [ ] Cannot access other users' data via API
- [ ] RLS policies are enabled and working

### Input Validation
- [ ] File size limits enforced (25MB)
- [ ] Audio format validation works
- [ ] User authentication required
- [ ] Call ownership verified before transcription

---

## üí∞ Cost Tracking

### OpenAI Whisper Pricing
- **$0.006 per minute** of audio

Example costs:
- 5-minute call = $0.03
- 10-minute call = $0.06
- 30-minute call = $0.18
- 100 calls @ 5 min = $3.00

### Monitor Usage

Query to check costs:
```sql
SELECT 
  COUNT(*) as total_transcriptions,
  SUM(audio_duration_seconds) / 60 as total_minutes,
  ROUND(SUM(audio_duration_seconds) / 60 * 0.006, 2) as estimated_cost_usd
FROM transcription_jobs
WHERE status = 'completed'
  AND user_id = auth.uid();
```

---

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Issue: "OpenAI API key not configured"
**Solution:** 
1. Check `.env.local` has `OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...`
2. Restart dev server: `npm run dev`
3. Verify key is valid on OpenAI dashboard

### Issue: "Transcription failed"
**Check:**
1. OpenAI API status: https://status.openai.com
2. API credits available in OpenAI account
3. Audio file is valid (not corrupted)
4. File size under 25MB

### Issue: Transcript not appearing
**Debug:**
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Query database: `SELECT * FROM transcripts WHERE call_id = 'your-call-id'`
3. Check RLS policies are correct
4. Verify user_id matches

### Issue: Audio player not loading
**Check:**
1. Signed URL generation in browser DevTools
2. Storage bucket permissions in Supabase
3. Audio file exists in storage
4. CORS settings if needed

---

## üìä Database Queries (Helpful for Debugging)

### Check transcription status
```sql
SELECT 
  c.id,
  c.filename,
  c.created_at,
  t.transcription_status,
  t.confidence_score,
  t.processing_started_at,
  t.processing_completed_at,
  tj.status as job_status,
  tj.error_message
FROM calls c
LEFT JOIN transcripts t ON c.id = t.call_id
LEFT JOIN transcription_jobs tj ON c.id = tj.call_id
WHERE c.user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY c.created_at DESC;
```

### Get transcription statistics
```sql
SELECT * FROM get_transcription_stats(auth.uid());
```

### View recent jobs
```sql
SELECT 
  id,
  call_id,
  status,
  created_at,
  started_at,
  completed_at,
  error_message
FROM transcription_jobs
WHERE user_id = auth.uid()
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

## 📊 What the AI Analyzes

The AI evaluates:

### Call Quality Indicators
- **Opening**: Professional greeting, practice name mention
- **Verification**: Patient identity confirmation
- **Purpose**: Clear understanding of caller's needs
- **Scheduling**: Urgency, specific times, confirmations
- **Rebuttals**: Handling objections effectively
- **Communication**: Clarity, pauses, professionalism
- **Empathy**: Caring tone, concern for patient
- **Satisfaction**: Overall caller experience

### Context Understanding
- **Call Direction**: Inbound vs outbound
- **Call Type**: Appointment, inquiry, confirmation
- **Conditional Criteria**: Automatically determines applicability
- **Evidence**: Quotes specific transcript sections

## 🎯 Accuracy & Confidence

### High Confidence (80-95%)
- **Indicators**: Clear transcript, obvious criteria met/not met
- **Trust Level**: Generally accurate, minor adjustments may be needed
- **Example**: Professional greeting clearly stated

### Medium Confidence (60-79%)
- **Indicators**: Some ambiguity in transcript or criteria interpretation
- **Trust Level**: Good starting point, review carefully
- **Example**: Rebuttal handling with nuanced responses

### Low Confidence (<60%)
- **Indicators**: Unclear transcript, complex situations, multiple interpretations
- **Trust Level**: Use as rough guide, manual review essential
- **Example**: Determining if caller was frustrated

## ✅ Best Practices

### DO ✅
- **Review Every Score**: Don't blindly accept AI suggestions
- **Read AI Reasoning**: Understand why AI scored that way
- **Check Evidence**: Verify AI quoted correct transcript sections
- **Adjust Appropriately**: Change scores where AI is wrong
- **Add Your Notes**: Supplement AI notes with your observations
- **Use as Starting Point**: Saves time but needs human oversight

### DON'T ❌
- **Skip Review**: Never save without checking scores
- **Blindly Trust**: AI can misinterpret context
- **Ignore Discrepancies**: If score seems wrong, investigate
- **Use for Final Decision**: Human judgment is final authority
- **Expect Perfection**: AI is assistant, not replacement

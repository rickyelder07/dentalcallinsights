## Security Implementation

### Row Level Security (RLS)

All QA tables have RLS policies enabled:

1. **call_scores**: Users can only view/edit their own scores
2. **score_criteria**: Users can only access criteria for their scores
3. **qa_assignments**: Users can view assignments assigned to them or created by them
4. **qa_templates**: Users can only manage their own templates

### API Security

- All endpoints require authentication (except `/api/qa/criteria`)
- Authorization tokens validated on every request
- User ownership verified before data access
- Input validation on all submissions
- Score ranges validated (0 to criterion weight)
- Call ownership verified before scoring

### Best Practices Followed

✅ No service role keys exposed to client
✅ All user inputs validated
✅ Supabase auth best practices
✅ Proper CORS handling
✅ Session management via RLS

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Efficient Queries**
   - Indexed columns for fast lookups
   - Selective field fetching
   - Aggregated views for dashboard

2. **Caching Strategy**
   - Static criteria definitions cached client-side
   - Score calculations performed client-side
   - Minimal API calls

3. **UI Optimizations**
   - Real-time score updates without API calls
   - Progressive loading of dashboard data
   - Optimistic UI updates

## Success Metrics

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Call must have a completed transcript"
- **Solution**: Ensure call has been transcribed via /api/transcribe

**Issue**: "Unauthorized" error when scoring
- **Solution**: Verify user is logged in and owns the call

**Issue**: Dashboard shows no data
- **Solution**: Ensure at least one score has been submitted

**Issue**: Score not saving
- **Solution**: Check browser console for validation errors

**Issue**: Categories not summing to 100
- **Solution**: Check which criteria are marked as "not applicable"

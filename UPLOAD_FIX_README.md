# Upload Fix - Large File Support

## Problem Solved
The application was experiencing **413 Payload Too Large** errors when uploading multiple large audio files because Vercel has a 4.5MB request body limit for serverless functions.

## Solution Implemented
The upload process has been redesigned to upload files **individually** instead of in a single batch request.

### New Upload Flow
1. **CSV Processing**: First, the CSV file is processed to extract metadata
2. **Individual File Uploads**: Each audio file is uploaded separately with its metadata
3. **Progress Tracking**: Real-time progress updates for each file
4. **Error Handling**: Individual file errors don't stop the entire upload process

### New API Endpoints
- `/api/upload/process-csv` - Processes CSV data and creates records for calls without audio
- `/api/upload/single` - Uploads individual audio files with metadata

### Benefits
- ✅ **No more 413 errors** - Each request stays under Vercel's 4.5MB limit
- ✅ **Better progress tracking** - See exactly which file is being uploaded
- ✅ **Improved error handling** - Failed files don't affect successful uploads
- ✅ **Retry logic** - Automatic retries for network errors
- ✅ **Same user experience** - The UI remains the same for users

## Technical Details

### File Size Limits
- **Individual files**: Up to 100MB each
- **Total upload**: No practical limit (files uploaded individually)
- **Supported formats**: MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC

### Error Handling
- Network errors are automatically retried up to 3 times
- Individual file failures are reported but don't stop other uploads
- Detailed error messages for troubleshooting

### Performance
- Files are uploaded in sequence to avoid overwhelming the server
- Progress is tracked and displayed in real-time
- Failed uploads can be retried without re-uploading successful files

## Testing
To test the fix:
1. Upload a CSV file with call metadata
2. Upload multiple large audio files (up to 100MB each)
3. Monitor the progress bar - it should show individual file uploads
4. Check that all files are successfully processed

## Deployment
The changes are automatically deployed with your next Vercel deployment. No additional configuration is needed.

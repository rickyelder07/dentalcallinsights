# Transcription Corrections Display Fix

## Issue Summary

Transcription corrections were being applied during the transcription process and saved correctly to the database, but the corrected text was not appearing on the frontend in the Transcript tab.

## Root Causes

### 1. **Conditional `edited_transcript` Saving**
The transcribe API route was only saving `edited_transcript` when it differed from the raw transcript:
```typescript
edited_transcript: correctedText !== whisperResponse.text ? correctedText : undefined
```

This meant that if corrections didn't change anything, `edited_transcript` would be `null`, and the frontend would fall back to displaying the raw transcript.

### 2. **Legacy Transcripts**
Transcripts created before correction rules were added to the user's profile would naturally show uncorrected text (e.g., "Silicate Stencil" instead of "Sola Dental").

### 3. **Edit Count Confusion**
The "Edited 1 time" indicator increments when users manually edit via Edit Mode, but this can be confusing when corrections aren't visible, making it seem like changes were lost.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **Always Save Corrected Text** âœ…
Updated `app/api/transcribe/route.ts` to always save the corrected text to `edited_transcript`:
```typescript
edited_transcript: correctedText, // Always save corrected version
transcript: correctedText, // Legacy field shows corrected
```

### 2. **Re-apply Corrections Endpoint** âœ…
Created new API route: `app/api/transcripts/[id]/apply-corrections/route.ts`
- Allows users to re-apply their current correction rules to existing transcripts
- Works without re-running expensive Whisper transcription
- Updates `edited_transcript` and `transcript` fields
- Verifies ownership and authentication

### 3. **UI Button for Re-applying Corrections** âœ…
Added "ðŸ”„ Apply Corrections" button to the call detail page (`app/calls/[id]/page.tsx`):
- Appears next to "Edit Mode" toggle
- Shows confirmation dialog before applying
- Refreshes transcript display after completion
- Provides user feedback on success/failure

## How to Use

### For New Transcriptions
1. Set up correction rules in **Profile > Transcription Corrections**
2. Run transcription on a call
3. Corrections are automatically applied and saved to `edited_transcript`
4. Frontend displays corrected text via `getDisplayTranscript()`

### For Existing Transcripts
1. Navigate to a call detail page with an existing transcript
2. Click **"ðŸ”„ Apply Corrections"** button
3. Confirm the action
4. The transcript will be updated with your current correction rules
5. Refresh the page to see the corrected text

## Technical Details

### Display Priority
The `getDisplayTranscript()` utility function prioritizes fields in this order:
1. `edited_transcript` (user edits or applied corrections)
2. `raw_transcript` (original Whisper output)
3. `transcript` (legacy field)

### Database Schema
- `raw_transcript`: Original Whisper output (never changes)
- `edited_transcript`: Text with corrections applied or manual edits
- `transcript`: Legacy field, now stores corrected text for backward compatibility
- `edit_count`: Tracks manual edits only (not automatic corrections)

### Workflow
```
Whisper API â†’ raw_transcript (stored)
      â†“
applyUserCorrections()
      â†“
edited_transcript (stored)
      â†“
Frontend displays edited_transcript
```

## Files Modified

1. **app/api/transcribe/route.ts**
   - Always save corrected text to `edited_transcript`

2. **app/api/transcripts/[id]/apply-corrections/route.ts** (NEW)
   - POST endpoint to re-apply corrections to existing transcript

3. **app/calls/[id]/page.tsx**
   - Added `handleReapplyCorrections()` function
   - Added "ðŸ”„ Apply Corrections" button to UI

## Testing

1. âœ… Create a correction rule (e.g., "Silicate Stencil" â†’ "Sola Dental")
2. âœ… Transcribe a new call â†’ corrections should appear automatically
3. âœ… Click "ðŸ”„ Apply Corrections" on an old transcript â†’ corrections should apply
4. âœ… Verify `edited_transcript` is always populated in database
5. âœ… Verify frontend displays corrected text

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add bulk "Apply Corrections" to all transcripts in library
- [ ] Show indicator when corrections have been applied vs. manual edits
- [ ] Add "Revert to Raw" button to restore original Whisper output
- [ ] Track correction application history

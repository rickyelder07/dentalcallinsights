feat: implement milestone 3 - audio upload & storage with CSV integration

Complete implementation of file upload system with comprehensive features:
- Audio file uploads (MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC) with drag-and-drop
- CSV call data upload and validation
- Intelligent call matching with confidence scoring
- Real-time upload progress tracking
- Secure storage with RLS policies and user isolation

BREAKING CHANGES:
- Adds new database columns to calls table
- Requires storage bucket creation
- New RLS policies must be applied

Core Features:
- Drag-and-drop file upload interface
- Server-side file validation (type, size, format)
- CSV parsing with detailed validation and error reporting
- Automatic call matching using time, phone, and duration
- Real-time progress indicators with speed and ETA
- Metadata form for call information
- Match review interface with confidence scores
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms

Technical Implementation:
- TypeScript strict mode with full type safety
- Client-side validation with server-side verification
- RLS policies for user data isolation
- Chunked uploads for large files (future-ready)
- Exponential backoff retry logic
- Sanitized file names and paths
- JSONB metadata storage for flexibility

Security:
- Never exposes service role keys to client
- All operations use anon key with RLS
- Input validation and sanitization
- Path traversal prevention
- File type and size enforcement
- User-scoped storage paths

API Endpoints:
- POST /api/upload - Upload audio with metadata
- GET /api/upload - List user's uploads
- POST /api/csv-upload - Upload and process CSV
- GET /api/csv-upload - Get user's CSV data
- POST /api/match-calls - Find potential matches
- PUT /api/match-calls - Link call with CSV data

Components:
- AudioUploader: Drag-and-drop audio file upload
- CsvUploader: CSV file upload with validation
- CallMatcher: Match review and selection interface
- MetadataForm: Call information input form
- UploadProgress: Real-time progress tracking

Database Changes:
- migrations/003_storage_setup.sql: Storage configuration
- Updated calls table with storage columns
- Enhanced csv_call_data table with indexes
- Database functions for matching
- RLS policies for storage.objects

### Description
```markdown
## Overview
Complete implementation of Milestone 3: Audio Upload & Storage system with comprehensive CSV call data integration.

## Features Implemented
✅ Audio file upload (MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC)
✅ Drag-and-drop interface
✅ CSV call data upload and parsing
✅ Intelligent call matching
✅ Real-time progress tracking
✅ Secure storage with RLS
✅ Comprehensive validation
✅ Error handling and recovery

## Database Changes
- Added storage columns to `calls` table
- Enhanced `csv_call_data` table
- Created matching functions
- Added RLS policies for storage

## Setup Requirements
1. Run migration `003_storage_setup.sql`

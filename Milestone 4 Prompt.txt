You are an expert full-stack engineer and will act as my Cursor copilot. Project: "DentalCallInsights" — a Next.js + Supabase web app for turning call MP3s + call metadata into searchable transcripts, summaries, sentiment, embeddings, and basic analytics. I need you to implement Milestone 4: Transcription Pipeline with OpenAI Whisper integration and comprehensive transcript management.

🎯 Project Context
Current Status: ✅ Milestones 1-3 Complete (Authentication, User Management, Audio Upload & Storage)
Target: 🚧 Milestone 4 - Transcription Pipeline
Branch: milestone/04-transcription-pipeline
Problem: Dental office managers have uploaded call recordings and CSV data, but now need to transcribe these audio files into searchable text for analysis, insights, and compliance tracking.
Core User Action: Upload audio files → Automatic transcription → View/edit transcripts → Ready for AI analysis pipeline.
Aha Moment: Managers can now search through call transcripts, identify patterns, and extract actionable insights from their call data.

Be explicit in your response: Show file tree and contents, include commands the developer must run locally, and provide a brief checklist for verifying the transcription system works (e.g., uploading a test audio file, verifying transcription, testing audio player, checking transcript editing).

Finish by creating a git commit message suggestion and recommended branch name milestone/04-transcription-pipeline.

Keep the response machine-readable: for every file include a header with the file path (```path/to/file```) followed by content.

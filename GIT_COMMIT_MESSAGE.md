# Suggested Git Workflow for Milestone 1

## Branch: `milestone/01-scaffold`

## Commit Message

```
feat: complete Milestone 1 - project scaffold and architecture baseline

## What's Included

### Core Application Structure
- Next.js 14 with TypeScript and App Router
- TailwindCSS configured with custom color palette
- Root layout with navigation (Login, Upload, Library, QA)
- Landing page with feature cards and call-to-action
- Placeholder pages for Upload, Library, QA, and Login routes

### Supabase Integration
- Supabase client configuration (lib/supabase.ts)
- Environment variable setup with .env.example template
- Type definitions for database tables

### Database Schema (migrations/001_init.sql)
- `calls` table for audio file metadata with JSONB metadata column
- `transcripts` table for transcription results and AI insights
- `embeddings` table with pgvector support (vector dimension: 1536)
- Optimized indexes:
  - GIN index on metadata JSONB
  - Full-text search index on transcripts
  - ivfflat vector index for semantic search
- Utility function: search_embeddings() for similarity search
- RLS policies commented out (to be enabled in production)

### Code Quality & Tooling
- ESLint configured with TypeScript rules
- Prettier configured with project standards
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- .gitignore configured to exclude .env.local and node_modules

### Documentation
- README.md with comprehensive setup instructions
- CODEFLOW.md with architecture overview and roadmap
- SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md with quick-start guide
- Inline code documentation for all major components

### NPM Scripts
- dev: Start development server
- build: Production build
- lint: Run ESLint
- format: Auto-format with Prettier
- type-check: TypeScript validation
- db:migrate: Migration instructions

## Technical Decisions

- **pgvector dimension (1536)**: Sized for OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002
- **JSONB metadata**: Flexible schema for patient IDs, tags, custom fields
- **ivfflat index**: Balanced performance for vector similarity search
- **App Router**: Leverages React Server Components for performance
- **No auth yet**: RLS policies commented out, to be enabled in Milestone 2

## Next Steps (Milestone 2)

- Implement Supabase Auth (email/password, OAuth)
- Enable Row Level Security policies
- Add protected routes with middleware
- Create user profile and session management

## Verification Steps

✅ npm install runs without errors
✅ npm run dev starts server on port 3000
✅ Home page renders with navigation
✅ All placeholder pages accessible
✅ No TypeScript errors
✅ Linter passes
✅ Database schema documented and ready to deploy

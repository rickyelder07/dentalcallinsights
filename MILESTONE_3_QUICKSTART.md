# Milestone 3: Quick Start Guide

**TL;DR**: Complete audio upload system with CSV integration is ready. Follow these steps to deploy.

## ✅ What Was Built

- Audio file uploader (MP3, WAV, M4A, AAC)
- CSV call data importer
- Intelligent call matching
- Real-time progress tracking
- Secure storage with RLS
- Complete API and UI

## 🚀 Quick Deploy (5 Steps)

### 1. Run Database Migrations

Copy and run in Supabase SQL Editor:

```bash
# Migration 003: Storage setup
migrations/003_storage_setup.sql

# Migration 004: CSV data (if not already run)
migrations/004_csv_call_data.sql
```

### 2. Create Storage Bucket

In Supabase Dashboard → Storage:
- **Name**: `call-recordings`
- **Public**: ❌ OFF
- **Size Limit**: `104857600` (100MB)
- **MIME Types**: `audio/mpeg, audio/wav, audio/x-m4a, audio/mp4, audio/aac`

### 3. Verify RLS Policies

Check that these policies exist on `storage.objects`:
- ✅ "Users can view own files"
- ✅ "Users can upload own files"
- ✅ "Users can update own files"
- ✅ "Users can delete own files"

### 4. Deploy Code

```bash
npm install  # No new dependencies needed
npm run build
npm run start
```

### 5. Test Upload

1. Navigate to `/upload`
2. Upload test MP3 file
3. Verify success
4. Check database and storage

## 🧪 Quick Test

### Test 1: Audio Upload
```bash
1. Go to http://localhost:3000/upload
2. Drag MP3 file onto uploader
3. Fill metadata (optional)
4. Click "Upload File"
5. ✅ Should see success message
```

### Test 2: CSV Upload
```bash
1. Create CSV with headers:
   CALL TIME, CALL DIRECTION, SOURCE NUMBER, ...
2. Upload via CSV uploader
3. ✅ Should see validation success
```

### Test 3: Call Matching
```bash
1. Upload CSV first
2. Upload audio with matching time
3. ✅ Should see potential matches
4. Select match
5. ✅ Should link successfully
```

## 🔒 Security Checklist

- [x] No service role keys exposed
- [x] RLS policies active
- [x] User data isolated
- [x] File validation on server
- [x] Size limits enforced
- [x] Path traversal prevented

## 📊 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | How to Test |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| 10MB upload | < 30s | Upload small file |
| 100 row CSV | < 1s | Upload CSV file |
| Match finding | < 2s | Test matching |
| Page load | < 2s | Visit /upload |

## 🐛 Common Issues

### Issue: Upload fails
**Fix**: Check storage bucket exists and RLS policies are active

### Issue: CSV validation errors
**Fix**: Verify CSV format matches expected schema

### Issue: No matches found
**Fix**: Ensure CSV data uploaded first, check time tolerance

### Issue: Permission denied
**Fix**: Verify RLS policies on storage.objects table

## 🚀 Next Steps (In Order)

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This installs `@supabase/auth-helpers-nextjs` and other packages.

### 2. Enable Email Auth in Supabase

1. Open [Supabase Dashboard](https://app.supabase.com)
2. Go to **Authentication > Configuration > Sign In / Providers**
3. Enable **Email** provider
4. (Optional) Enable email confirmations and password recovery

### 3. Run RLS Migration

1. In Supabase Dashboard, go to **SQL Editor**
2. Click **New Query**
3. Copy entire contents of `migrations/002_enable_rls.sql`
4. Paste and click **Run**
5. Verify success: no errors in output

### 4. Verify RLS is Enabled

Run this query in SQL Editor:

```sql
SELECT tablename, rowsecurity
FROM pg_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'public'
AND tablename IN ('calls', 'transcripts', 'embeddings');
```

**Expected:** All tables show `t` (true) for `rowsecurity`.

### 5. Start Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 6. Test Authentication

1. Visit http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Sign Up" in navigation
3. Create test account (email: `test@example.com`, password: `TestPass123!`)
4. Verify redirect to `/library`
5. Check navigation shows your email
6. Try accessing `/profile`
7. Click "Sign Out"
8. Try accessing `/library` → should redirect to login

## 📝 Testing Checklist

### Basic Auth Flow
- [ ] Sign up with valid email/password
- [ ] Password strength indicator works
- [ ] Sign in with correct credentials
- [ ] Cannot sign in with wrong password
- [ ] Session persists after page refresh
- [ ] Can sign out successfully

### Route Protection
- [ ] `/library`, `/upload`, `/qa`, `/profile` require authentication
- [ ] Unauthenticated users redirected to `/login`
- [ ] Authenticated users redirected away from `/login`

### Password Management
- [ ] Can request password reset email
- [ ] Password reset link works
- [ ] Can update password from profile

### Row Level Security
- [ ] Create two test users (User A, User B)
- [ ] User A cannot see User B's data in SQL queries
- [ ] Each user only sees their own calls

## 🔒 Security Notes

✅ **Service role key** is in `.env.local` only (never exposed to client)  
✅ **RLS enabled** on all tables - user data is isolated  
✅ **Middleware protects** routes on server-side  
✅ **Session tokens** stored in httpOnly cookies (XSS protection)  
✅ **Password validation** enforces strong passwords  

---

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Missing Supabase environment variables"
→ Ensure `.env.local` exists with valid `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL` and `NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`

### "new row violates row-level security policy"
→ Make sure you're using the current user's ID when inserting data:
```typescript
const { data: { user } } = await supabase.auth.getUser()
await supabase.from('calls').insert({ user_id: user.id, ... })
```

### Auth not working after deployment
→ Set environment variables in Vercel dashboard and redeploy

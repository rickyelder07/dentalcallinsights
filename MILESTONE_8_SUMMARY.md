## 🔄 Migration Path

### Step 1: Database
```sql
-- Run in Supabase SQL Editor
-- File: migrations/013_qa_scoring_schema.sql
```

### Step 2: Verification
```sql
-- Verify tables
SELECT table_name FROM information_schema.tables 
WHERE table_name LIKE 'call_%' OR table_name LIKE 'qa_%';

-- Should return: call_scores, score_criteria, qa_assignments, qa_templates
```

### Step 3: Deploy Code
```bash
# All code already in place
# Deploy via your normal process
npm run build
vercel deploy
```

### Step 4: Test
- Access Library (Enhanced)
- Score a call
- Check QA Dashboard
- Verify data accuracy

## 🎓 Training Resources

### For Implementation Team
1. Read MILESTONE_8_COMPLETE.md
2. Review database schema
3. Test API endpoints
4. Understand scoring criteria

### For End Users
1. Read MILESTONE_8_QUICKSTART.md
2. Score 5 practice calls
3. Explore QA Dashboard
4. Review criteria definitions

## 💡 Key Design Decisions

1. **Conditional Criteria**: Some criteria only apply to specific call types (appointments vs. inquiries)
2. **Score History**: Multiple scores per call preserved, latest shown by default
3. **Real-time Calculation**: Total score calculated client-side for instant feedback
4. **Category Tabs**: Grouped criteria by category to reduce cognitive load
5. **Side-by-side Layout**: Transcript and scoring form visible simultaneously
6. **Flexible Assignment**: Assignments optional, scoring can be ad-hoc
7. **Draft Status**: Allows saving work-in-progress scores

## 🔮 Future Enhancement Ideas

### Phase 2 (Potential)
- AI-powered scoring suggestions from transcript analysis
- Automated quality checks
- Custom scoring criteria
- Multi-reviewer consensus
- Advanced filtering and search

### Phase 3 (Potential)
- Integration with training systems
- Automated coaching recommendations
- Gamification and leaderboards
- Real-time quality monitoring
- Predictive analytics

# 🚧 Milestone 3 In Progress: Audio Upload & Storage

**Status:** 🚧 **IN PROGRESS**  
**Branch:** `milestone/03-audio-upload-and-storage`  
**Started:** December 2024  
**Target Completion:** End of December 2024

## 📋 Overview

Milestone 3 focuses on implementing audio file upload and storage capabilities using Supabase Storage. This milestone builds upon the completed authentication system to provide secure, user-isolated file storage for dental call recordings.

## 🎯 Objectives

### Core Features
- [ ] Audio file upload interface with drag-and-drop
- [ ] Supabase Storage integration with RLS policies
- [ ] Upload progress indicators and validation
- [ ] Metadata form for call information
- [ ] File type and size validation
- [ ] Error handling and retry logic
- [ ] CSV call data upload functionality
- [ ] Call recording to CSV data matching system
- [ ] CSV data validation and parsing
- [ ] Call correlation and matching algorithms

### Security Requirements
- [ ] User data isolation in storage (RLS policies)

---

## 🏗️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Storage Infrastructure
- [ ] Configure Supabase Storage bucket (`call-recordings`)
- [ ] Set up RLS policies for user isolation
- [ ] Configure file size limits and allowed types
- [ ] Test storage access permissions

### Phase 2: Upload Interface
- [ ] Create `AudioUploader` component with drag-and-drop
- [ ] Implement upload progress indicators
- [ ] Add file validation (type, size, format)
- [ ] Create metadata form for call information
- [ ] Add error handling and retry logic

### Phase 3: Backend Integration
- [ ] Create API route for file uploads (`/api/upload`)
- [ ] Implement server-side file validation
- [ ] Add database records for uploaded files
- [ ] Handle upload completion and cleanup

### Phase 4: Testing & Polish
- [ ] Test with multiple file types and sizes
- [ ] Verify user data isolation
- [ ] Test error scenarios and recovery
- [ ] Optimize upload performance
- [ ] Add loading states and user feedback
